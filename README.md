# Surprise-Housing-Project

### Introduction

A US-based company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

For some purpose, the company has collected a dataset from the sale of houses in Australia. I, as a Data Science Intern was required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.
